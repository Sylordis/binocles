# Binocles

The softwareâ€™s purpose is to facilitate the beta reading of texts by their users. It allows the user to:
- define and manage their own commenting nomenclature with different comment styles.
- manage the texts in different books containing chapters, each text being one chapter.
- comment the texts with comments of different types with visual feedback and indicators on the text in review.
- save their current work to re-open it at a later date.
- export/import current or previous work.
- render their reviews in different formats so it can be displayed or shared easily on different platforms.
